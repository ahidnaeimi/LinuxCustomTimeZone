# Create Tehran TZ in Linux 2022

### Time Zone Database (TZ Database)

You can download the latest time zone database from this link: https://www.iana.org/time-zones

### Zone File, UTC Offset, Rule

The files are text files and contains the below information about a time zone:

- Definition of a time zone
- Daylight saving time (DST) rules
- Names of time zones

##### Example
```

#
# The following rules are approximations starting in the year 2088.
# These are the best post-2088 approximations available, given the
# restrictions of a single rule using ordinary Gregorian dates.
# At some point this table will need to be extended, though quite
# possibly Iran will change the rules first.
Rule	Iran	2088	max	-	Mar	20	24:00	1:00	-
Rule	Iran	2088	max	-	Sep	20	24:00	0	-

### Make The Time Zone
Prepare the zone file and make any change that you want, then compile it with the below command:
```
zic {The zone file path} -d .
```
If there is no problem, then youâ€™ll have your own time zone. The file will be created according to the zone file name but time zone name will be same as `Zone Name`.

### Usage manual

git clone https://github.com/ahidnaeimi/Linux_TZTehran2022.git

cd Linux_TZTehran2022
